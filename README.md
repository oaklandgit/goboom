### To Do

- every object should have a unique id. For groups of objects append an index
- figure out why bricks example isn't rendering the brick group properly
- get collisions working (start with circle collisions)
- utilize delta time

### Backlog

- load sprite atlas
- tilemaps
- define animations from sprite atlas
- implement motion scripts / tweening (e.g. for enemy movement)
- Implement convenience functions for velocities
